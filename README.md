# KaiOSGameTemplate_240x320
# Template Project for KaiOS apps
## KAIOS Phaser 3 Template for Web Games

Games are to be played via the browser.
Games are locked at 240x320 pixels screen size (was 240x228 but kept being rejected because it's not fullscreen during testing....so...yeah...that :/ )

Full screen enabled via '#'
Pause button is '*' only if actvated in code.

Using latest Phaser (currently 3.22.x) custom build with window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ( was window.requestAnimationFrame ) to maintain 60fps
