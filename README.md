## KIAOS Phaser 3 Template for Web Games

Games are to be played via the browser.
Games are locked at 240x320 pixels screen size (was 240x228 but kept being rejected because it's not fullscreen during testing....so...yeah...that :/ )

Full screen enabled via '#'
Pause button is '*'

Using latest Phaser linked to CDN (currently 3.21.x)

~~WHEN UPDATING PHASER YOU MUST CHANGE window.requestAnimationFrame TO window.mozRequestAnimationFrame
OTHERWISE IT'S 30fps~~
